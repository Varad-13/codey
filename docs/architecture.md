# Architecture Overview

Codey is designed with a modular architecture to ensure both flexibility and scalability. Below is a breakdown of its key components and their interactions.

## Core Components

1. **Chat Interface**: The primary entry point for user interaction. This is where all chat-based functionality is initiated.

2. **Tools**: A collection of specialized modules that perform specific tasks. These tools are invoked by the chat interface based on user queries. The current tools include:
 - **Calculate Tool**: Handles mathematical operations.
 - **File Management Tools**: Manage files such as reading and writing.
 - **Git Tools**: Interact with version control functionalities.

3. **Config Management**: Responsible for loading and managing configurations, including API keys and model names, ensuring the system operates with the appropriate settings.

4. **Sanitization Module**: Ensures that inputs processed by Codey are safe and sanitized to prevent potential security issues resulting from user inputs.

5. **Logging**: Maintains logs of all operations and interactions, providing an audit trail that can be useful for debugging and tracking purposes.

## Flow of Execution

1. **User Initiates Chat**: The user starts a chat session.
2. **User Input**: Codey captures the user input and determines the intended action.
3. **Invoke Relevant Tool**: Based on the input, Codey invokes the appropriate tool or processes the request directly.
4. **Return Response**: After processing, Codey returns the output to the user in the chat interface.

This modular architecture allows for easy addition of new tools and functionalities without disrupting existing features, supporting the ongoing development and enhancement of Codey.
