# Logging

Logging is an essential feature in Codey that helps track and monitor the application's behavior and user interactions. By maintaining detailed logs, developers can gain insights into the operations of Codey and troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Purpose of Logging
- **Debugging**: Logs provide a historical record of events, making it easier to identify the cause of issues.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous logging allows for real-time monitoring of the applicationâ€™s performance and health.
- **Audit Trail**: Logging creates a transparent record of user actions and system responses, which is crucial for accountability in applications.

## Key Features
- **Configurable Logging Levels**: Codey allows different logging levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, enabling you to filter logs based on the importance of messages.
- **Output to File**: Logs can be saved to a file, providing persistent access to historical data for later analysis.
- **Timestamped Entries**: Each log entry includes a timestamp, making it easier to correlate events over time.

## Integration with Codey
Logging in Codey is automatically integrated throughout the application. Key events and errors are captured in real-time, ensuring that relevant information is always available for review. When running commands, users can also see logs related to the operations performed by Codey, enhancing usability and transparency.

## Example Log Output
A sample log entry generated during a Codey operation might look like this:
```
2023-10-01 12:34:56 - INFO - User initiated chat session.
2023-10-01 12:34:57 - DEBUG - Executing: calculate with expression '5 + 10'.
2023-10-01 12:34:57 - INFO - Calculation result: 15.
```

By implementing an effective logging system, Codey provides valuable insights into its operations, helping developers maintain a high-quality user experience.
