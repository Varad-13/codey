# Sanitization

The sanitization module in Codey plays a crucial role in ensuring that all user inputs are safe and secure. This is particularly important when handling dynamic data from users, as it helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as code injection or other malicious exploits.

## Purpose of Sanitization
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input meets certain criteria, reducing the risk of errors during execution.
- **Security**: Strips out unsafe control characters while preserving useful data, ensuring that any commands executed are safe.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains the integrity of the data being processed by collapsing excessive whitespace, and truncating overly long inputs where necessary.

## Key Features
- **Control Character Filtering**: The sanitization process removes control characters (C*) from user input, except for newlines and tabs, which can be critical for text formatting.
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Excessive or repeated whitespace is collapsed into a single space, making the input cleaner and more manageable.
- **Length Enforcement**: Inputs are truncated to a predefined maximum length to prevent excessively large input strings that could lead to performance issues or buffer overflows.

## Example Usage
When a user inputs a request, the sanitization module processes it to ensure it is safe for evaluation:
```python
user_input = " This is a test input with excessive whitespace. "
 sanitized_input = sanitize_payload(user_input)
```

After sanitization, `sanitized_input` will be cleaned up:
```python
"This is a test input with excessive whitespace."
```

## Integration with Codey
Sanitization is an automatic process integrated into Codeyâ€™s workflow. Whenever user input is captured, it is immediately sanitized before any processing or execution occurs. This ensures all commands executed by Codey are based on safe and validated input, contributing to the overall security and reliability of the application.

By implementing proper sanitization measures, Codey enhances the user experience while minimizing risks associated with dynamic data handling.
