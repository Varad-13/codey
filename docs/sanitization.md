# Sanitization

The sanitization module in Codey ensures that all user inputs are safe and compatible with Python file handling. This is crucial for handling inputs from the OpenAI tokenizer, which may produce unexpected non-UTF-8 characters.

## Purpose of Sanitization
- **Error Prevention**: Safeguards against invalid characters that can cause Python file reading to fail.
- **Security**: Removes unsafe or control characters from user inputs, preventing potential exploits.

## Key Features
- **Character Filtering**: Strips out non-UTF-8 characters and control characters, ensuring safe and consistent data.
- **Whitespace Management**: Normalizes excessive whitespace for cleaner input processing.
- **Automatic Integration**: Sanitization occurs automatically whenever user input is captured, ensuring that all commands executed by Codey are based on safe and validated input.

By implementing effective sanitization measures, Codey enhances usability while minimizing errors associated with invalid data.
