# Usage

After successfully installing Codey, you can use it through the command line interface (CLI) in chat mode. Below are instructions on how to get started.

## Running Codey
To execute Codey, simply open your terminal and type:

```bash
codey
```

Once you run this command, you will enter a chat session where you can interact with the integrated AI. Feel free to ask questions or issue commands as you would in a normal conversation.

## Example Interaction
Here is an example of how a command might look in the chat:

```
User: What is the sum of 5 and 10?
Codey: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
```

Codey will automatically determine the nature of your request and respond accordingly. Enjoy exploring the capabilities of Codey!
